It has 3 steps as you can see the folders:


1. SPL Token Creation: in this we create a spl token that we are gonna use in further minting of NFTs.

2. Candy Machine Deploy: Now we need to deploy the candy machine in the devnet with all the assets and their associated JSONs.

3. Candy Machine UI: In this step we need to configure the UI with the deployed candy machine and then we can just connect our wallet and mint NFTs using our tokens.
